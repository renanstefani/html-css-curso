        <p>Hey, little train! Wait for me!
            I once was blind but now I see
            Have you left a seat for me?
            Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
            Hey, little train! Wait for me!
            I was held in chains but now I'm free
            I'm hanging in there, don't you see
            In this process of elimination
